## Ultra-Sonic Sensor

The main process of this sensor is to calculate the distance to an obstacle. The sensor emits a wave and calculates the distance by the time it takes to reflect in the face of an obstacle. For example, the reader system and the bats used this method. This ultrasonic sensor includes two knobs. One knob emits a pulse and the other knob detects the pulse. This sensor cannot be used for long distances. The maximum value is 25-30 cm. I am not satisfied with the values ​​beyond that. It is more suitable for short distances. If you need long-distance sensors, there are various sensors available in the market. Waterproof sensors are also available in the market. Below is how the ultrasonic sensor works with the Arduino board. The components required for this project and how to purchase these components are given below. we can use the serial monitor to watch the sensor readings.
